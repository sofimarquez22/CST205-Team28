# CST205-Team28 Final Project

A program that launches a window which will allow the user to encode and decode a secret message. At the top of the window a button is provided which will create a pop-up window with images and a description to show the user how to use the program step by step. Below the how to button, there is a slot for the user to enter their message and select an image from their computer. Once an image and message are selected, the user can click decode to display the hidden message on their terminal.
